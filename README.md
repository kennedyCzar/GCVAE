## GCVAE: Generalized-Controllable Variational Autoencoder

### ABSTRACT: 
```
Variational autoencoders (VAEs) have recently been used for unsupervised disentanglement 
learning of complex density distributions. While numerous variants exist to encourage 
independence of variables in the latent space and implying improvement in the 
reconstruction, none have significantly managed the tradeoff between 
reconstruction error and kullback-leibler divergence. We present a generalized framework 
to handle this challenge under the constrained optimization framework and show that 
it outperforms state-of-the-art existing models for disentanglement while balancing 
reconstruction. We prove that maximizing the information in the generative network is 
equivalent to information maximization during amortized inference underreasonable 
assumptions and constraint relaxation.
